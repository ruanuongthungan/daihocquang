          ‚Äúü§ì‚Äù? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life
          writing all of that and your response to me is ‚Äúü§ì‚Äù? Are you so
          mentally handicapped that the only thing you can comprehend is ‚Äúü§ì‚Äù
          are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short
          response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was
          written was?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p id="blog-left-p">
          Well, Will have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in
          fact, I even had my written work proofread by several professors of
          literature. Don't believe me? doubt you would, and your response to
          this will probably be ‚Äúü§ì" once again.

          Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck
          about one fucking emoji? I bet you took the time to type that emoji
          too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty
          seconds before pressing "send. You‚Äôre so fucking pathetic. I'm
          honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply
          far too nice to do something like that.

  <h4>About Us</h4>
  <p>
    My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
    Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. <br />
    If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my
    brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over
    a year now, <br />
    and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I
    use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine.
